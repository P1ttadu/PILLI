<br>PILLI was my first prototype. I am programming it with C++, in the view that arduino uno supports C++. It is an IOT projects runs with help of Ultrasonc sensor and other components. This project uses Find-S algorithm to perform various tasks.It is constantly trained by data sets taken input. It is a component of 'PROJECT':"VM333".
<br>
<br> VM333- is virtual lifefrom(monster) it takes input from IOT components and provides output through LCD or OLED screen.
<br> This project is done with ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
